# minecraft-world-downloader
A Minecraft world downloader that works as a proxy server between the client and the server to read & save chunk data. Download multiplayer worlds by connecting to them and walking around. Chunks can be sent back to the client to extend the render distance.

> **This fork adds:** support for **every version from 1.8 through 26.1**, a fix for the 1.20.2+
> *"Connection Lost — Loading NBT data"* error, and a **Dockerized web console** for running and managing
> the downloader from your browser (Microsoft / access-token / offline account login, live logs, and
> world export).

## 🚀 Mega update — automation & container capture

This release adds opt-in automation features and fixes several long-standing bugs in the
container-capture path. **Everything below was verified end-to-end** with a real Paper server driven by
a [mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer) bot through the proxy — the full matrix
(**1.12.2, 1.20.4, 1.21.8, 1.21.11**) passed **3/3 runs each**: world download → auto-open + saving of
every container type → chat auto-reply. The downloaded worlds were then **re-opened in a fresh server**
and a bot read the chests back to confirm the items are correct **in-game**, not just in the NBT bytes.

### ✨ New features
- **🤖 Auto-open container sweep now actually works on modern servers.** As you move, the proxy opens
  nearby containers one at a time (rate-limited) and saves their contents — no manual clicking.
  Verified for **all block container types**: chest, trapped chest, barrel, furnace, blast furnace,
  smoker, hopper, dropper, dispenser, brewing stand, shulker boxes, **and crafters** (1.21+).
  Enable with `--auto-open-containers`.
- **🛒 Container minecarts** (chest / hopper minecarts) are auto-opened too. They're entities, so their
  captured contents are written into the saved chunk's entity NBT (verified by reading the minecart's
  items back out of the saved region).
- **📝 Auto-open item log.** Every auto-opened container is appended to a human-readable
  `auto-open-items.log` (beside the world folder) listing the type, coordinates and items, e.g.
  `minecraft:overworld chest @ 12 -60 5 (3 stacks, 81 items)` → `minecraft:diamond x12`. Customize the
  path with `--auto-open-log`.
- **💬 Chat auto-reply.** When an incoming chat message's trigger-coloured text matches a configured
  trigger, the proxy replies with that message's reply-coloured text. Colours default to **yellow →
  red** but are configurable (`--auto-reply-trigger-color` / `--auto-reply-color`) so any colour
  combination works. Works on legacy (pre-1.19) and modern (signed-chat) protocols. Enable with
  `--auto-reply --auto-reply-trigger "<text>"`.
- **🛡️ Player-aware chest safety (on by default).** The sweep will **not** open a chest / trapped chest
  / barrel while another player is within `--auto-open-player-radius` (default 100). All other container
  types still open. Pass `--auto-open-allow-chest-near-players` to disable the check.

### 🐛 Fixes
- **Saved containers looked empty in 1.20.5+ Minecraft**: the item NBT stack size moved from `Count`
  (byte) to `count` (int) in 1.20.5, but the downloader still wrote `Count`, so the client read a
  default of 1 for every stack. Now writes the correct format per version — confirmed by loading the
  downloaded world in a real server and reading the exact chest contents back.
- **1.21.5+ world download was broken** (chunks failed to parse → 0 chunks saved): 1.21.5 removed the
  per-array "data length" varint from paletted containers; the long count is now derived from
  bits-per-entry. Verified downloading + saving on 1.21.8 and 1.21.11.
- **Auto-open kicked you on 1.21.3+**: the serverbound *Use Item On* packet gained a `worldBorderHit`
  boolean that the injected open omitted ("Failed to decode use_item_on"). Now written/parsed on 1.21.3+.
- **Auto-open never worked on 1.14+**: the injected open used the pre-1.14 block-position bit layout, so
  modern servers silently ignored it. Now version-correct (`x<<38 | z<<12 | y` on 1.14+).
- **1.14–1.18 auto-open** wrote a stray block-change sequence field (a 1.19+ addition), corrupting the
  packet. Now gated to 1.19+.
- **1.12.2 item names never resolved** (the bundled `items-1.12.2.json` was parsed into the wrong
  shape), so saved chests had broken item ids. Fixed — and metadata variants (e.g. red wool) are now
  distinguished in the log.
- **1.12.2 auto-open** now uses the correct pre-1.14 *Player Block Placement* packet layout.

### 🔌 Also ported from [TheHecateII's fork](https://github.com/TheHecateII/minecraft-world-downloader)
- **Player skin-heads on the map** — other players render as their Minecraft head (face + hat) instead
  of a dot, with a memory + disk skin cache and async Mojang fetch (gated by `--render-players`).
- **Modded block colours** — non-`minecraft:` blocks are coloured on the map from their mod-JAR
  texture (in `.minecraft/mods`), falling back to a deterministic per-name colour (`--modded-block-colors`).
- **Voice-chat UDP proxy** — `--enable-voice-proxy` transparently relays Simple Voice Chat / PlasmoVoice
  so voice works through the downloader (auto-detects the voice port from plugin-channel packets).
- **Modded/1.21 hardening** — clientbound `CustomPayload` mapped for 1.20.6/1.21 (Forge/NeoForge plugin
  channels), plus null-safety fixes so unknown/modded block, item and entity ids no longer crash chunk
  parsing or NBT writing.

### ✅ Verified versions
End-to-end (Paper server + mineflayer bot through the proxy), **3/3 runs each** on **1.12.2, 1.20.4,
1.21.8, 1.21.11**: world download, auto-open + saving of every container type, and chat auto-reply.
The player-aware chest safety has its own two-bot test, and minecart capture + the in-game load-back
(re-open the downloaded world in a server and read the chests with a bot) are verified too.

### ⚠️ Known limitations
- **26.1.2** cannot be exercised by a bot yet — mineflayer/minecraft-data have no 26.x protocol data
  (`unsupported protocol version: 26.1.2`). The proxy's 26.1 mapping reuses the verified 1.21.5+ chunk
  and signed-chat paths, so the same code is covered by the 1.21.8/1.21.11 tests.
- On 1.12.2, **furnaces and brewing stands** aren't auto-opened (their block state resolves to a null
  name in the bundled 1.12 block registry).

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7FIJ6fZ.png" width="80%" title="Example of the GUI showing all the downloaded chunks as white squares, which ones from a previous download greyed out.">

### Requirements
- Java 21 or higher
- Minecraft version 1.8+ // 1.9+ // 1.10+ // 1.11+ // 1.12.2+ // 1.13.2+ // 1.14.1+ // 1.15.2+ // 1.16.2+ // 1.17+ // 1.18+ // 1.19.3+ // 1.20+ // 1.21+ // 26.1

### Command-line
[Download](https://github.com/cafepromenade/minecraft-world-downloader/releases/latest/download/world-downloader.jar) the cross-platform `world-downloader.jar` and run it using the command-line:

```
java -jar world-downloader.jar
```

Arguments can be specified to change the behaviour of the downloader. Running with `--help` shows all the available commands.
```
java -jar world-downloader.jar --help
```

The GUI can be disabled by including the `--no-gui` option, and specifying the server address:
```
java -jar world-downloader.jar --no-gui -s address.to.server.com
```

### Running on Linux
To easily download the latest release using the terminal, the following commands can be used:
```
wget https://github.com/cafepromenade/minecraft-world-downloader/releases/latest/download/world-downloader.jar
java -jar world-downloader.jar -s address.to.server.com
```

When running headless Java, the GUI should be disabled by including the GUI option:
```
java -jar world-downloader.jar -s address.to.server.com --no-gui
```

Some linux distributions may require `-Djdk.gtk.version=2` for the GUI to work:
```
java -Djdk.gtk.version=2 -jar world-downloader.jar
```

### Docker + web console
The project ships a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` that run the downloader headless behind a
small **web management console** which mirrors every command-line option. See the
[Docker & web console](https://github.com/cafepromenade/minecraft-world-downloader/wiki/Docker-Web-Console)
wiki page for the full guide.

```
docker compose up -d --build
```

Then open **http://localhost:8080** — the console has **no login by default** (set `WEB_PASSWORD`
to gate it behind a username/password if you expose it beyond localhost). From the console you can:
- **sign in to your Minecraft account** three ways — **Microsoft** (device-code login: open the link,
  enter the code), **access token** (paste an existing token), or **offline** username,
- set every option (server address, ports, render distance, world output, center offset, and all the
  map/behaviour toggles) — the same flags as the command line,
- **start / stop / restart** the downloader,
- watch live logs and status,
- **save** all settings (persisted to the volume),
- **export the world** as `.zip` or `.tar.gz`, or snapshot the directory into `./data/exports`.

Point your Minecraft client at `localhost:25565` (the proxy port) to download a world. Worlds, the
registry cache, your account session and saved settings persist in the `./data` folder (mounted at `/data`).

| Port | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| 8080 | Web management console |
| 25565 | Minecraft proxy — connect your client here |

Environment variables: `WEB_PORT`; `WEB_USERNAME` + `WEB_PASSWORD` (optional — set both to require a
console login; off by default); `SECRET_KEY` (auto-generated if unset, only used when login is enabled);
and `MS_CLIENT_ID` (Azure/Microsoft OAuth client id for Microsoft login; defaults to the public
Minecraft launcher client id).

### Desktop manager (Windows)
A small **WinUI 3** desktop app (`desktop/`) sets up and runs the Dockerized console for you: pick the
folder where worlds and data are stored, choose the ports and (optional) login, then **Start** — it
launches the container and opens the console in your browser. Download the **NSIS installer** from the
[releases](https://github.com/cafepromenade/minecraft-world-downloader/releases) page (built by the
`Desktop manager release` GitHub Actions workflow on each `v*` tag). It uses the image published to
`ghcr.io/cafepromenade/minecraft-world-downloader`. Requires [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
