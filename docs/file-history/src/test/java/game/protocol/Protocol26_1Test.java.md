## Purpose

26.1 (protocol 775) cannot be exercised by a live bot — mineflayer/minecraft-data have no 26.x protocol data ("unsupported protocol version: 26.1.2"). This test instead asserts that the proxy's 26.1 mapping is wired to the SAME code paths that are verified end-to-end on 1.21.8/1.21.11: the 1.21.5+ chunk handling, the 1.21.3+ Use Item On worldBorderHit field, NBT chat, and the serverbound ChatMessage id used by the auto-reply.
