## Purpose

Handles voice-mod plugin channels (Simple Voice Chat, PlasmoVoice). When a voice server info packet is intercepted: - A UDP proxy is started on localhost:<voicePort> forwarding to realServer:<voicePort>. - If the packet advertises a non-local host, it is rewritten to advertise an empty host so the Minecraft client falls back to using the Minecraft server address (= localhost = our proxy). This lets clients behind the world-downloader MITM proxy reach voice servers that would otherwise only be reachable via UDP directly to the remote server's IP.
