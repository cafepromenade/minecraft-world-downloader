## Purpose

A container minecart (chest / hopper minecart). Minecarts are entities, not block entities, so their captured contents are written into the saved entity NBT (the chunk's "Entities" list) rather than as a block entity. Populated by the (opt-in) auto-open sweep when it interacts with the minecart.
