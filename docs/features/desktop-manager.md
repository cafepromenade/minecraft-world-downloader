# Desktop manager (C# WPF)

> A Windows desktop GUI that configures and runs the world-downloader web console as a Docker container, and drives the optional BlueMap 3D-map and mineflayer auto-explore bot helpers.

## What it does

The desktop manager (`WorldDownloaderManager`) is a single-window Windows app that wraps the world-downloader so a user never has to type a `docker run` command. From one screen it lets you:

- Pick a **data folder** on the PC (mapped into the container as `/data`) where downloaded worlds, the block/registry cache, the Minecraft account session and console settings live.
- Configure the **web console port** (default `8080`), the **Minecraft proxy port** (default `25565`), the **Docker image**, and an optional **console login** (username/password).
- **Start** / **Stop** the container, **Open console** (browser to `http://localhost:<web port>`), open the **Live map** (`/map`), **Update image** (docker pull), and **Generate compose** (write a `docker-compose.yml` into the data folder).
- Render an interactive **3D map with BlueMap** (optionally upgrading the world with a server jar first) and open it.
- Run one or more **mineflayer auto-explore bots** that connect through the proxy and walk/fly a grid so an area downloads automatically.
- Show **live output** from every command it runs, plus a status banner.
- Switch **theme** (Dark / Light / High contrast) and toggle **Large text** for accessibility.

Settings persist between launches, and unhandled errors are caught and logged rather than silently killing the window.

## How it works

**Stack & shell.** The app is a WPF app (`WorldDownloaderManager.csproj`: `UseWPF=true`, `OutputType=WinExe`, `TargetFramework=net8.0-windows`, `RuntimeIdentifiers=win-x64;win-arm64`). Note: several header comments describe it as "WinUI 3", but the actual project is WPF. The UI is defined in `MainWindow.xaml` (a single scrollable `StackPanel` of "card" sections) with all logic in the `MainWindow` code-behind.

**Startup & crash handling.** `App.OnStartup` (`App.xaml.cs`) wires three global handlers — `DispatcherUnhandledException` (marked `Handled = true` so the app survives UI errors), `AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException`, and `TaskScheduler.UnobservedTaskException`. Each calls `Report`, which appends the exception to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\WorldDownloaderManager\crash.log` and shows a `MessageBox`.

**Settings.** `Settings` (`Settings.cs`) is a POCO serialized to `%APPDATA%\WorldDownloaderManager\settings.json`. `Settings.Load()` falls back to defaults on any read/parse error and, if `DataFolder` is empty, defaults it to `%USERPROFILE%\WorldDownloader`. Defaults: `WebPort=8080`, `ProxyPort=25565`, `Image=ghcr.io/cafepromenade/minecraft-world-downloader:latest`, `ContainerName=minecraft-world-downloader`, `RequireLogin=false`, `Username=admin`, `Password=""`. `Save()` swallows write errors.

**Docker integration.** `DockerService` (`DockerService.cs`) is a thin wrapper over the `docker` CLI. `RunAsync` launches `docker` with `UseShellExecute=false`, streams stdout/stderr (UTF-8) line-by-line to the `OnOutput` callback (the app routes this to the log box), and returns `(exitCode, capturedOutput)`. Key operations:
- `IsDockerAvailableAsync` → `docker version --format {{.Server.Version}}` (success = exit 0).
- `IsRunningAsync(container)` → `docker ps --filter name=^/<container>$ --filter status=running --format {{.Names}}`.
- `RemoveAsync` → `docker rm -f <container>`.
- `PullAsync` → `docker pull <image>`.
- `RunContainerAsync(settings)` → `docker run -d --name <name> --restart unless-stopped -p <web>:8080 -p <proxy>:25565 -v <dataFolder>:/data [-e WEB_USERNAME=… -e WEB_PASSWORD=…] <image>`. The login env vars are only added when `RequireLogin` is true **and** the password is non-empty.

**Main flow.** `MainWindow` constructs a `Settings` (via `Load`) and a `DockerService`, binds the UI fields, and on `Loaded` runs `InitAsync`: if Docker is unavailable it sets an error status and stops; otherwise `RefreshStatusAsync` checks whether the container is running and enables/disables Start vs Stop accordingly. `SaveFromUi` reads the UI back into `Settings` (ports validated by `ParsePort`, which accepts integers in `1..65535` and otherwise uses a fallback) and saves.
- **Start** (`Start_Click`): saves, requires a data folder, creates it, `docker rm -f` any stale container, then `RunContainerAsync`; on exit code 0 it opens the console in the default browser.
- **Stop** (`Stop_Click`): `docker rm -f` the container.
- **Update image** (`Pull_Click`): `docker pull`.
- **Generate compose** (`GenerateCompose_Click`): writes `Settings.WriteDockerCompose()` output into the data folder and opens the folder in Explorer. The compose maps `<WebPort>:8080` and `<ProxyPort>:25565`, sets `WEB_PORT: "8080"`, conditionally writes `WEB_USERNAME`/`WEB_PASSWORD`, and mounts `<dataPath>:/data` (backslashes converted to forward slashes).
- **Open console / Live map**: `Process.Start` to `http://localhost:<webPort>` and `…/map`.
- A `Busying(bool)` helper toggles the indeterminate progress bar and disables Start/Stop/Pull/Browse while work is in flight.

**Theme & accessibility.** Brushes in `MainWindow.xaml` are declared `po:Freeze="False"` so they can be recolored at runtime. `ApplyTheme` swaps brush colors for Dark / Light / High contrast via `SetBrush` (which replaces a brush if it happens to be frozen, avoiding a crash). `LargeText_Changed` scales the root panel via a `ScaleTransform` (1.0 ↔ 1.25).

**BlueMap 3D map.** `RenderMap_Click` requires a data folder, then locates `bluemap/pipeline.py` via `FindPipeline` (checks next to the executable, one level up, then `<data>/bluemap`). It derives `world=<data>/world`, `workdir=<data>/bluemap`, `webroot=<workdir>/web`, builds a `settings.json` from the UI (`acceptDownload:true`, `renderThreadCount`, `webserverEnabled:true`, `webserverPort`, and the chosen `dimensions` of overworld/nether/end), and invokes the pipeline as `<py> pipeline.py all --world … --out … --workdir … --settings …` plus `--server-jar <jar>` if one is set. `RunPythonAsync` tries `python`, then `python3`, then `py` in order, streaming output. `OpenMap_Click` opens `http://localhost:<bmPort>`.

**Auto-explore bot.** `BotStart_Click` saves, refuses to double-start, requires a data folder, and locates `scraper/scrape.js` via `FindScraper` (same three-location search as BlueMap). It builds a JSON config (`ui-config.json` written next to `scrape.js`) containing `host:127.0.0.1`, `port:<proxyPort>`, an `accounts` array (one per bot; auth `offline`/`microsoft`, usernames suffixed `1,2,…` when count > 1), `centerOnSpawn`, `radius`, `preferFly`, `revisit`, optional `loginPassword` (AuthMe), and a `visitedFile` at `<data>/bot-visited.json`. On first run, if `node_modules` is missing it runs `npm install --no-audit --no-fund` (trying `npm.cmd` then `npm`). It then starts `node scrape.js --config ui-config.json` (trying `node` then `node.exe`), tracks the process in `_botProc`, wires `Exited` to re-enable Start, and `BotStop_Click` kills the process tree.

**Packaging / install.** CI (`.github/workflows/desktop-release.yml`) runs `dotnet publish … -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true -o …\publish` on `windows-latest`, installs NSIS via Chocolatey, and runs `makensis` passing `APP_VERSION`, `SRC_DIR=…\publish`, and `OUT_FILE`. On a `v*`/`desktop-v*` tag the `.exe` installer is attached to a GitHub release. `installer/installer.nsi` (NSIS + MUI2) installs to `$PROGRAMFILES64`, requires admin, copies the published tree, creates Start-menu and Desktop shortcuts, writes Add/Remove Programs (`Uninstall`) registry entries, and provides an uninstaller that removes the install dir, shortcuts, and registry keys.

## Key files

- `desktop/MainWindow.xaml` — single-window UI layout: status banner, data-folder picker, configuration card, action buttons, BlueMap card, bot card, output log, theme/large-text controls, and all styles/brushes.
- `desktop/MainWindow.xaml.cs` — all UI logic: settings binding, Docker start/stop/pull/compose, browser launches, theme switching, BlueMap rendering (Python), and the mineflayer bot launcher (npm/node).
- `desktop/Settings.cs` — persisted settings model (`%APPDATA%\WorldDownloaderManager\settings.json`), defaults, and `ToDockerCompose`/`WriteDockerCompose`.
- `desktop/DockerService.cs` — `docker` CLI wrapper: availability/running checks, `rm -f`, `pull`, and `run` with port/volume/login mapping.
- `desktop/App.xaml.cs` — global exception handlers and crash logging to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\WorldDownloaderManager\crash.log`.
- `desktop/WorldDownloaderManager.csproj` — WPF / `net8.0-windows` project; `win-x64`/`win-arm64` RIDs.
- `installer/installer.nsi` — NSIS installer (shortcuts, Add/Remove Programs entry, uninstaller).
- `.github/workflows/desktop-release.yml` — publishes self-contained `win-x64` build and packages it with NSIS, attaching to a release on tag.
- `bluemap/pipeline.py` — external helper the app shells out to for world upgrade + BlueMap render/serve (not part of the C# project).
- `scraper/scrape.js` — external mineflayer auto-explorer the app shells out to (not part of the C# project).

## Configuration / flags

The app has **no command-line flags**. User-facing configuration lives in the UI and persists to `settings.json`:

- **Data folder** — host path mounted as `/data`.
- **Web console port** (`WebPort`, default `8080`) — published as `<WebPort>:8080`.
- **Minecraft proxy port** (`ProxyPort`, default `25565`) — published as `<ProxyPort>:25565`.
- **Docker image** (`Image`, default `ghcr.io/cafepromenade/minecraft-world-downloader:latest`).
- **Require a login** (`RequireLogin`, default off) with **Console username** (`Username`, default `admin`) and **Console password** (`Password`). When enabled (and password non-empty) these are passed to the container as `WEB_USERNAME` / `WEB_PASSWORD` env vars (the generated compose always sets `WEB_PORT: "8080"`).
- `ContainerName` (default `minecraft-world-downloader`) — persisted but not surfaced as an editable field in the UI.

BlueMap card settings (written to `<data>/bluemap/settings.json`, not persisted in `settings.json`): server jar path (optional), render threads (`0`=auto), web map port (default `8100`), and dimension checkboxes (overworld/nether/end).

Bot card settings (written to `scraper/ui-config.json`, not persisted in `settings.json`): account type (Offline/Microsoft), username (default `Scraper`), radius (default `256`), bot count (default `1`), AuthMe login password, and the toggles Center on spawn / Fly (creative) / Revisit downloaded.

Build-time NSIS defines (`installer.nsi`): `APP_VERSION`, `SRC_DIR`, `OUT_FILE` — supplied by CI. The hardcoded default `SRC_DIR` in the script points at a `net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0\...\publish` path that does not match the actual `net8.0-windows` build output; CI overrides it with an explicit `SRC_DIR`, so the stale default is never used in the release build.

## Usage

1. Install Docker Desktop and make sure it is running. (Node.js and Python+Java are only needed for the bot and BlueMap features respectively.)
2. Install the manager from the NSIS setup `.exe` (or run a local `dotnet publish`/`dotnet run` of `desktop/WorldDownloaderManager.csproj`) and launch it.
3. Choose a data folder with plenty of free space.
4. Adjust ports / image / login if needed, then click **Start**. The app starts the container and opens the console in the browser. In Minecraft, connect to `localhost:<proxy port>` instead of the real server to download.
5. Use **Open console** / **Live map** to reopen the web UI, **Update image** to pull the newest build, **Generate compose** to write a `docker-compose.yml` (run it with `docker compose up -d`), and **Stop** to remove the container (worlds in the data folder are kept).
6. Optionally render a **3D map** (set a server jar if you want the world upgraded first, choose dimensions/threads/port, click **Render 3D map**, then **Open 3D map**), and/or start the **auto-explore bot** (pick account, radius, count, click **Start bot**).

## Verification

- **Compile/build-verified via CI**: `.github/workflows/desktop-release.yml` does a self-contained `win-x64` publish on every tag/dispatch and packages it with NSIS, so the C# project and installer script are exercised end to end in CI.
- A prior `desktop/bin/Release/...` and `desktop/publish-test/` build output tree exists in the working copy, indicating local publish runs have succeeded.
- **No automated unit/integration tests** for the manager itself were found in this area — Docker interaction, BlueMap, and bot launching are not covered by an automated test harness. Their correctness depends on the behavior of the external `docker` CLI, `bluemap/pipeline.py`, and `scraper/scrape.js`, which the app only shells out to. Treat runtime behavior of the GUI as manually/CI-build-verified, not integration-tested.

## Gotchas & limitations

- **Windows-only.** WPF + `net8.0-windows`; the bot/python launchers also probe Windows-style executables (`npm.cmd`, `node.exe`, `py`).
- **Console password is stored in plaintext** in `settings.json` and is written verbatim into `docker run -e WEB_PASSWORD=…` and into the generated `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Compose values are not escaped/quoted defensively.** `ToDockerCompose` interpolates username/password directly into double-quoted YAML; values containing quotes or special characters could produce invalid YAML.
- **Docker must be present and running**; if `docker version` fails the app shows an error and does not retry automatically (you must reopen the app).
- **`ContainerName` is fixed via settings only** — there is no UI to run multiple containers with different names at once.
- **External helpers are not bundled by the C# project.** `bluemap/pipeline.py` and `scraper/scrape.js` must be discoverable next to the executable, one directory up, or under the data folder; if missing, the feature reports an error. Whether the installer ships them depends on what is present in the published output tree (`File /r "${SRC_DIR}\*.*"`), which is not guaranteed by the csproj itself.
- **BlueMap needs Python + Java; the bot needs Node.js** on PATH. Missing toolchains surface as log/status errors only.
- **"WinUI 3" naming is inaccurate** — comments in `installer.nsi` and the release workflow call it WinUI 3, but it is a WPF app.
- **Generate-compose sets `WEB_PORT: "8080"`** (container-internal) and relies on the host port mapping for the actual exposed port; this is internal-vs-host port wiring that may confuse users editing the file by hand.
